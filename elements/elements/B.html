<p class="txt"><strong>What's in a name?</strong> From the Arabic word <strong>Buraq</strong> and the Persian word <strong>Burah</strong>, which are both words for the material "borax."</p>

<p class="txt"><strong>Say what?</strong> Boron is pronounced as <strong>BO-ron</strong>.</p>

<p class="txt"><strong>History and Uses:</strong></p>

<p class="history">Boron was discovered by Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis-Jaques Thénard, French chemists, and independently by Sir Humphry Davy, an English chemist, in 1808. They all isolated boron by combining boric acid (H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>) with potassium. Today, boron is obtained by heating borax (Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>·10H<sub>2</sub>O) with carbon, although other methods are used if high-purity boron is required.

</p><p class="history">Boron is used in pyrotechnics and flares to produce a green color. Boron has also been used in some rockets as an ignition source. Boron-10, one of the naturally occurring isotopes of boron, is a good absorber of neutrons and is used in the control rods of nuclear reactors, as a radiation shield and as a neutron detector. Boron filaments are used in the aerospace industry because of their high-strength and lightweight.
</p><p class="history">
</p><p class="history">Boron forms several commercially important compounds. The most important boron compound is sodium borate pentahydrate (Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>·5H<sub>2</sub>O). Large amounts of this compound are used in the manufacture of fiberglass insulation and sodium perborate bleach. The second most important compound is boric acid (H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>), which is used to manufacture textile fiberglass and is used in cellulose insulation as a flame retardant. Sodium borate decahydrate (Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>·10H<sub>2</sub>O), better known as borax, is the third most important boron compound. Borax is used in laundry products and as a mild antiseptic. Borax is also a key ingredient in a substance known as Oobleck, a strange material 6th grade students experiment with while participating in Jefferson Lab's BEAMS program. Other boron compounds are used to make borosilicate glasses, enamels for covering steel and as a potential medicine for treating arthritis.</p>
