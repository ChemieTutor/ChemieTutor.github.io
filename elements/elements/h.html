<p class="txt"><strong>What's in a name?</strong> From the Greek words <strong>hydro</strong> and <strong>genes</strong>, which together mean "water forming."</p>

<p class="txt"><strong>Say what?</strong> Hydrogen is pronounced as <strong>HI-dreh-jen</strong>.</p>

<p class="txt"><strong>History and Uses:</strong></p>

<p class="history">Scientists had been producing hydrogen for years before it was recognized as an element. Written records indicate that Robert Boyle produced hydrogen gas as early as 1671 while experimenting with <a >iron</a> and acids. Hydrogen was first recognized as a distinct element by Henry Cavendish in 1766.

</p><p class="history">Hydrogen is the raw fuel that most stars 'burn' to produce energy. The same process, known as fusion, is being studied as a possible power source for use on earth. The sun's supply of hydrogen is expected to last another 5 billion years.
</p><p class="history">
</p><p class="history">Hydrogen is a commercially important element. Large amounts of hydrogen are combined with <a">nitrogen</a> from the air to produce ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) through a process called the Haber process. Hydrogen is also added to fats and oils, such as peanut oil, through a process called hydrogenation. Liquid hydrogen is used in the study of superconductors and, when combined with liquid oxygen, makes an excellent rocket fuel.
</p><p class="history">
</p><p class="history">Hydrogen combines with other elements to form numerous compounds. Some of the common ones are: water (H<sub>2</sub>O), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), table sugar (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and hydrochloric acid (HCl).

</p><p class="history">Hydrogen has three common . The simplest isotope, called protium, is just ordinary hydrogen. The second, a stable isotope called deuterium</a>, was discovered in 1932. The third isotope, tritium</a>, was discovered in 1934.</p>
